# algo-py

## The python algorithm repository
The purpose of this repo is to explore and demonstrate the function of computer
science algorithms with file manipulation (using CSV files of random numbers).

The functional file contains I/O functions for ingressing and egressing data.

### Algos covered:
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Quick Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort

More to come!

#### inputout.py
* Contains functions that are imported into algorithm scripts for ingressing/
exporting data to csv

#### list-generator.py
* Used to create randomly-generated CSVs for testing algorithm performance

#### selection-sort.py
* Basic selection sort algorithm, n\*n=n^2 complexity (very slow)

#### tripler.py
* Serves as a proof-of-concept for file manipulation
