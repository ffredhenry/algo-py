# algo-py

## The python algorithm repository
The purpose of this repo is to explore and demonstrate the function of computer
science algorithms with file manipulation (using CSV files of random numbers).

The functional file contains I/O functions for ingressing and egressing data.

### Algos covered:
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Quick Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort

More to come!


## Ideas
- concatenate strings to create a sorted csv separate from intake, e.g. ./input.csv -> ./input-sorted.csv [-4] index?
- ebic 1337 hacker progress bar fed from loop iterations -> output to console
- time study (how long does each take) + complexity log

### Other funcions

#### input-output.py
* Contains functions that are imported into algorithm scripts for ingressing/
exporting data to csv

#### list-generator.py
* Used to create randomly-generated CSVs for testing algorithm performance

#### tripler.py
* Serves as a proof-of-concept for file manipulation
